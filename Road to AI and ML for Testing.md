Road to AI and ML for Testing
=============================

WE BELIEVE the future of testing will include manual, automated, and AI driven testing. In an effort to prepare our team, not just to follow, but to lead the industry in this future, we began a journey to learn Python, AI and ML, and how it applies to testing. 

## Automation
After completing these tasks you should be comfortable with the basics of programming in Python and able to write basic automation using Selenium and Python.
